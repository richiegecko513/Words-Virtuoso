 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>Your friends made presents for your birthday, but they just numbered them without signing their names. The most desirable presents are from Alice and Victor, so you want to know which gifts are from them. Write a function <code class="java">findByIndex(names: Set&lt;String&gt;): String</code> and return the numbers of Alice's and Victor's presents separated by a space and a comma.</p> 
  <p>Sample input:</p> 
  <p><code class="java">Ann, Alice, Bonny, Victor, Tom</code></p> 
  <p>Sample output: </p> 
  <p><code class="java">1, 3</code></p>
